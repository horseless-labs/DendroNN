"""
Based on both visual validation and experimentation with training, it made sense to only accept
bark patches that the usable bark classifier was very confident was actually bark (>=99%). That
said, a user may sometimes have different needs, and this code gives some control over the
confidence of the data that is being partitioned.

Something more relevant to my needs now is the ability to craft differnet arrangements of the data,
e.g. alternating between family and species level, only using three different members, generating a
dataset for binary classification of maple or not, and such things. This is also meant to give a
user control over such arrangements.
